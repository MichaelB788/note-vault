## Image $Im(f)$

For every x in $Dom(f)$, $f(x)$ is called the image of x under $f$. We can put these 
transformations together to make an **image set** $Im(f)$, **or the set of
all values taken by the function f(x)**.

$$
Im(f) = { f(x) : x \epsilon Dom(f) }
$$
> Im(f) is a set of f(x) such that x is an element of Dom(f) (or set A)

### Map

Sometimes, functions are refered to as **maps**. This is because the behavior of a 
function $f$ **maps** S into T.

## Codomain

Codomains are a **set of images which derive from S after a transformation of $f$**.
In other words, they are the output after a transformation of $S$

$$
f : S \rightarrow T
$$
> This is read as "$f$ is a function with domain S and codomain T".

### Graph $G$

A function with domain S and codomain T may be graphed, or a subset of G, such that;

for each $x \epsilon S$ there is exactly one $y \epsilon T$ such that
$(x, y) \epsilon G$
