# Image $Im(f)$

For every x in $Dom(f)$, $f(x)$ is called the image of x under $f$. We can put these 
transformations together to make an **image set** $Im(f)$, **or the set of
all values taken by the function f(x)**.

$$
Im(f) = { f(x) : x \epsilon Dom(f) }
$$
> Im(f) is a set of f(x) such that x is an element of Dom(f) (or set A)

### Map

Sometimes, functions are refered to as **maps**. This is because the behavior of a 
function $f$ **maps** S into T.

## Codomain

Codomains are a **set of images which derive from S after a transformation of $f$**.
In other words, they are the output after a transformation of $S$

$$
f : S \rightarrow T
$$
> This is read as "$f$ is a function with domain S and codomain T".

### Graph $G$

A function with domain S and codomain T may be graphed, or a subset of G, such that;

for each $x \epsilon S$ there is exactly one $y \epsilon T$ such that
$(x, y) \epsilon G$

## Characteristic Fucntion $\chi A$

Characteristic functions contain unique elements such that x meets a condition; these 
functions behave much like piecewise functions in Algebra.

$$
\chi A = \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 1 & if & x \epsilon A, \\
0 & if & x \epsilon S \backslash A. 
\end{array} \right.
$$

For computers in particular, characteristic functions are particularly useful, as they 
can describe subsets of characteristic elements with bits 0 and 1.

## Composition Functions $g(f(x))$ 

We can compose two functions if we invoked a transformation such as S to T, and T to U.
This is moreso for brevity.

$$
(g \circ f) : S \rightarrow U
$$

$$
(g \circ f)(s) = g(f(s))
$$

### Assosciative Property of Functions

Functions are assosciative:

$$
h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f
$$

This is because no matter what order you compute the function expressions,
you'll always end up with the same result.
