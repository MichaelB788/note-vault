# Informal Introduction

## Symbolic Notation

| Symbol        | Meaning               |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| $\neg$        | Negation (Not)        |
| $\wedge$      | Conjunction (And)     |
| $\vee$        | Alternative (Or)      |
| $\rightarrow$ | Implication (Implies) |

## Converse 

When we say $p \rightarrow q$, the **converse** of that proposition would be 
$q \rightarrow p$. The two propositions have different meanings.

We could say that "Rainy weather implies that today is cloudy." However, we cannot say
"Cloudy weather implies that today is raining."

## Contrapositive

The proposition $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$ is the **contrapositive** of 
$p \rightarrow q$. In this particular case, the contrapositive is equivalent of the 
original proposition.

We could say that "No clouds implies that it is not raining." In fact, this follows 
logically with the proposition that "rainy weather implies that today is cloudy."

## Quantifiers

| Symbol      | Meaning       |
|-------------|---------------|
| $\forall$   | For all       |
| $\exists$   | Exists        |
| $\nexists$  | Doesn't exist |
