### Mali Empire
Grew along the Niger River Valley; made for efficient trade of gold, salt, copper and slaves.
So much gold was spent in the markets of Cairo; thus Mali's gold was important all over the world.

During the medieval period, West Aftica produced two-thirds of the world's supply of gold.
Mali supplied other trade items - ivory, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, hides, and slaves.

### Songhay Empire
Expands in the early 1500s as the Mali Empire declines; the trading city of Gao is the capital.

Timbuktu began as a seasonal settlement and became permanent earliy in the 12th century.

## Atlantic Slave trade
The enslavement of millions of Africans who were sent ot he Americas, from the fifteenth to the 
nineteenth centuries.

Until the nineteenth century, most settled agricultural societies used slave labor in some form. 

In Africa, most slaves were war captives, they worked as cultivators, but also held high ranking 
positions.

## Foundations of the Slave Trade
After the eighth century, Mulsim merchants sought slaves in Africa for sale in the Mediterrarian.
**Slave labor was an easy way to feed greed and make money. They were commodity.**
