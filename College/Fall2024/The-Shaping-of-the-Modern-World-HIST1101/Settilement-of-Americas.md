# Christopher Columbus

Private journals from Christopher Columbus reveals Columbus' first impressions of the 
people he met in the Caribbean Islands. While Columbus reated the indigenous people 
brutally, his slightly condescending notes were painted in a light of heroism.

He sees the natives as aliens which need to be converted to the Holy Faith.
