# Bernays Pt. 1 

## Torches of Freedom

During the 1920's smoking was considered a cardinal sin amongst women, and in society
only corrupted women smoked. However, orchestrated by Edward Bernays and Lucky Strike
propagated the idea that women smoking cigarretes was a sign of freedom.

This propaganda was spread through a fake protest which was set up during the 1920's,
in which several women went out of the streets to smoke cigarretes. It planted the 
idea that smoking was a sign of power.

Of course, this idea only benefits the egos of women and the pockets of Lucky Strike.

## It All Starts Here

Nephew of philosopher Sigmund Freud, Edward Bernays had a deep understanding of
psychoanalysis and manipulation.

Bernays first employed his skills when Woodrow Wilson announced to the nation that
the U.S would be joining WW1. Bernays was summoned by the president in order to spread 
propaganda. Since his methods worked extremely well, Bernays thought how well these 
methods of propaganda would work during times of peace.

Because propaganda was such a tainted word, Bernays disguised his methods under a new 
term: Public relations.

## The need for desire

After Bernays efforts proved extremely successful during WWI, Bernays now knew that 
people were "dopes." His views on the citizen was dehumanizing. "Stupid." "Dopes." 
"Sheep." These were the ways Bernays would refer to the average citizen. It's 
very telling of his character, how he views himself above the average person.

## Fear of overproduction

With the boom of industrialization, production of manufactured goods skyrocketed.
The problem was that with such a boom in production came a concern of overproduction.
The solution was to turn people into consumers; have them buy what they want, not 
what they need. This is the basis of consumerism.

Consumerism promotes happiness being linked to the individual's capacity to consume, 
advocates that spending is the engine for economic growth.

With this, people not only bought items for utility, but for flaunting wealth.

Bernays took advantage of consumerism by selling emotions over products. The 
pitch shifted from "you should buy this automobile" to "you would feel better if you"
had this automobile, according to Peter Strauss.

## The trick that saved US cars 

A majority of families in the US had owned a car, which created a saturated automobile
industry. 

Bernays proposed solution was to make cars a symbol of masculinity and planned
obsolence; put out new versions of cars, such that the new was most desirable and 
the old should be left in the dust.

## American breakfast is a lie 

Bernays was the first to utilize professionals in order to sell products. Bernays 
physician approved the notion that the body desired more calories in the morning and 
thus a heavier breakfast was more desireable. Bernays then told 5000 other psychicians
whether they agreed, and then they did. Once this got out to the public, the idea 
that a heavy breakfast was more ideal became ingrained within society.

The truth was that this is fallacy, but a profitable one, as America was sold the idea 
that eggs and bacon were the ideal for breakfast, increasing profits among the eggs and 
bacon industry.

## An abrupt end

Bernays reign over corporate America would come to an abrupt end once the Great 
Depression hit, which he had partially contributed to. People began excessively 
spending in order to satiate their need to consume. 

However, this didn't mean the end of Bernays himself. In fact, once the Great 
Depression had subsided, Bernays was back in business, and his tactics were even 
more effective than ever before.
