In 2002, Dr. Edward Samuels, a university professor at New York Law School, was
caught in possesion of child pornography. Following the arrest of Samuels, NY Law 
placed the professor on administrative leave such that "he may attend to his defense." 
They expressed grief over the creep, and had the gall to extend sympathy.

In April 2003, Samuels pled guilty to 100 counts of possesion of
child pornography.

However, the judge recieved several testimonial letters expressing "great respect"
for Samuels; his sentence was shortened to six months and 10 years' probation. Samuels 
would only serve four months.

Perry and Gross, helpdesk employees of Collegis who were tasked to help with Samuels, 
were also the ones to expose him. While they were excellent employees, they were fired.
Right before the company recieved a multimillion-dollar contract with the school.
