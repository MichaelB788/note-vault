# Chapter 1: An Overview of Ethics

### What is ethics, and why is it important to act according to a code of ethics?

A **code of ethics** is a statement that highlights an organization's key ethical issues
and identifies the overarching values and principles that are important to the
organization and its decision making.

The cornerstone of ethical behavior is **integrity**, which is basically treating
others with respect as you would expect for yourself.

It's important to act according to a code of ethics because the consequences of
falling out of line of the code could not only put yourself at harm, but others as
well.

### Why is business ethics becoming increasingly important?

Business ethics are becoming increasingly important because there is a trend of
increasingly unethical behavior withing the realm of business.

Some controversial practices in business tend to be:

- Offshoring overseas in order to exploit immoral working conditions in third-world
countries

- A recessionary economic climate incentivizes organizations to maintain revenue
and profits; the prioritization of the bottom-line over employee's.

- Poor accounting standards.

### What are organizations doing to improve their business ethics?

By implementing ethics management programs.

**Corporate ethics officers** provide an organization
with vision and leadership. They emphasize the importance of ethics and ideally 
report directly to the CEO.

The **board of directors** are responsible for management of an organization. They
are the ones to oversee business activities for the benefit of stakeholders (employees,
shareholder, customers, suppliers, and the community).

### Why are organizations interested in fostering good business ethics?

Fostering good business ethics is a good idea because the value of a company's stock
is influenced by public reception. Enforcing good business ethics results in a better
outlook of the company and better publicity, raising the price of stock.

It also comes back to the idea of integrity, and companies are implementing several
ways in order to maintain integrity.

Conducting **social audits** show how well a company is meeting its ethical 
and social responsibility of goals. This information is shared with stakeholders and 
the government.
