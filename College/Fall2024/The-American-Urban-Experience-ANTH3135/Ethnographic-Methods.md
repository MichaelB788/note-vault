# Ethnographic Methods

## The Old Way
In the early to mid 20th century (1900s to approx 1960), picking a
field site went something like this:

- An anthropologist wants to study people

- They go to the colonial office if they're British, or the Bureau of
Indian Affairs if they're American.

- The government funded researchers because to get info on how a tribe
of people are organized

## Counter-Currents
There has alwasy been intellectual dissent and resistance. Some 
anthropologists who've taken this approach are:

- Zora Neal Hurston

- W.E.B. DuBois

- Majorie Shostak

Predecessors to critical race theory, feminist, and Marxist approaches
today.

## Field Notes
Notes taken during fieldwork to be analyzed at the end of the research 
period. Two main kinds of field notes include:

- Jotting

- Journals

- Description vs interpretation
    - Always aim for the most precise description without interpretation

## Paricipant-Observation: The Basics
Participation in activities as part of an observation 

Depth of data:
- Interactions
- Affect (feeling)
- Rules
- Embodiment

These things set anthropology apart from other social sciences, 
especially length.
