# Why is Race significant in the US?

The US was founded as a white supremacist settler colony.

The US was central to the construction of race as a concept, racial classification of
laws and science. 

## Race and Racism

Racism: Individual thoughts and actions and institutional patterns and policies that 
create unequal access to power, privelege, etc.

Racism is not biological; it is socially constructed. It's been scientifically disproven 
that a person's genes create any sort of distinction between individuals. In fact, most 
genetic diversity stems from Africa, as homosapiens resisded in most parts of Africa (and 
Australia).

## Phenotype

Darker skin, which is caused by a higher volume of melatonin, often occurs due to exposure 
to the sun and UV rays. People of darker skin tones were common to people in areas near the 
equator due to it being closer to the sun. Farther north, skin tones became lighter due to 
an inverse effect.

## Race is Local

Race and racism is subjective to context; people from Brazil who may believe they're white 
would not be seen as white in the U.S., and they wouldn't be treated as one.

## Scientific Racism

Psuedoscience which is the use of scientific language and methodology to justify existing 
racial hierarchies and inequalities.

## The Construction of Race in the US 

The invention of whiteness, the cultural beleif surrounding who is white and not, and 
who should be entitled to the privileges of being white.

The Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 is importatn of note.

- Codified white supremacy: Belief that white people are biologically superior to others.
    - Barred black people from owning arms; regardless of being enslaved or free.
    
    - Prohibited white people from working for black people.

    - Prohibited black people from striking white people. 

These laws were the basis for later slaves codes, and the origin of Jim Crow.

The cumulation of all of these codes branded slaves as a lower kind of human; subhuman.

## Racism and Immigration in the US 

Nativism: Attitudes favoring long-term residents over newer arrival
- Fluctuates throigh US history.

Eugenics: a pseudoscience attempting to scientifically prove the biological existence of 
races, and imporover general genetic makeup by favoring some groups over others.
- The idea of "optimal genetics."
- This ideaology was enamored by liberal, middle-class white people, who wanted society to
rise in the ranks by having children who weren't darker tones.
