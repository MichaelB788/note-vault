## Project Ideas
A small space where I gather some ideas for cool projects to make.

Here's a quick list of everything that I would like to build so far:

Easy enough but challenging:
- Picross game, perhaps with SDL or similar
- Simon says in the terminal
- Tic-tac-toe with AI implementation
- Megaten fusion calculator (with a search function)

Tougher ideas:
- Tetris game
- Mario Bros.
- Text editor
- Snake game (on my own this time)
- Turn based RPG
- Emulator
